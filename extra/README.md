# Description

An alternative to [data-default][] package, but built on top of the same
underlying package [data-default-class][]. This package provides a lot of
additional instances for `Default` type class.

`Default` type class provides a default value (`def`) of a type. In case when a
particluar type has an instance for `Monoid`, then the default value should be
`mempty`, otherwise it can cause a great deal of confusion.

One must understand, that `Default` type class, has no axioms associated with
it. Its purpose is to minimize:

* Number of imports.

* Number of introduced definitions that are part of an API.

* Complexity of building more complicated "default values" out of simpler
  "default values".

* Cognitive overhead. (Reduction of cognitive overhead is partially a
  consequence of reducing above issues.)

As one may notice, most of the listed problems, that `Default` type class tries
to solve, to various degrees of success, are for human benefit, and not
theoretically founded. Because of this, please always try hard to define
sensible instances of `Default`. Most importantly, document what `def` means
for particular type, and always check that `def` is sensible, by testing it on
a real world sample of human beings, one is not a big enough sample.

That said, using `Default` may not always be a good idea. If it breaks people's
mental models, or theoretical models with real axioms, then just don't use it.

This package, in most part, just reexports a set of packages that provide
additional instances for [data-default-class][] package.


## GHC Generics

Create `Default` instances using [GHC Generics][].

Usage example:

```Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DefaultSignatures #-}

import GHC.Generics (Generic)
import Data.Default (Default)

data MyType = MyType Int (Maybe String)
  deriving (Generic, Show)

instance Default MyType
```

```
Î»> def :: MyType
MyType 0 Nothing
```

One can also use `DeriveAnyClass` language extension:

```Haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveAnyClass #-}

import GHC.Generics (Generic)
import Data.Default (Default)

data MyType = MyType Int (Maybe String)
  deriving (Default, Generic, Show)
```

Be aware that `DeriveAnyClass` doesn't work well together with
`GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving` on some versions of GHC. See [GHC issue #10598][]
